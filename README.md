#  Weather Prediction using Random Forest

##  **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions using historical meteorological data. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model building. After testing multiple models, **Random Forest** was found to perform the best due to its high accuracy and robustness.

---

##  **Goal**

To predict future weather conditions (such as temperature or rainfall) based on past weather data using machine learning techniques.

* **Model:** Random Forest Regressor / Classifier

---

##  **Process**

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Testing
5. Model Evaluation and Comparison
6. Selection of Best Model (Random Forest)

---

##  **Result**

The **Random Forest model** provided the highest accuracy and lowest error among all tested algorithms, effectively capturing complex weather patterns and ensuring reliable predictions.
